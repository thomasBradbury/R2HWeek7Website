            </li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/dRaQze">Monday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>A simple if else statement that checks whether a number is greater than or less than 10.</p>

            <p>In this codepen I was able to use an array of colors to console log a sentence including all of the colors in that array.</p>
            </li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/gREeyy">Wednesday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>In this codepen I made a program which would receive user input on what their birth month is and then console log out from a list of the months in a year whether each month is or is not their birth month.</p>
            </li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/yXwjVb">Thursday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>In this codepen I created a function which would receive two numbers as inputs and output their multiplicative sum.</p>
            </li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/yXwjzo">An Additional Quiz</a></li>
            <p>This codepen contains a for loop console logging a variable four times in a row.</p>

         <h1>Week 5 challenges</h1>
         <ul>
            </li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/OgYybv?editors=0012">Monday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>In this codepen I was able to take three individual items and then create an array of those three items using a function.</p>
            </li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/xrNZrp">Tuesday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>In this codepen I was able to choose a random item out of an array of objects.</p>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/EXBevZ">Wednesday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>In this challenge I was Instructed to build an object constructor which would build new objects as well as execute a function which would list several attributes of that object, as well as function which could evaluate a property of the object.</p>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/pwMeEX">Thursday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>This was another object constructor challenge. In this challenge we needed to not only consider the object we were building but the products within the object as well.</p>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/yXWeaO">Weekly Challenges</a></li>
            <p>For this week's challenge I needed to concatenate two sentences, create an array of three colors, loop through that array to list the colors out individually, match those colors to animals in an array of objects, loop through that array of objects, and finally determine which of six random pairings of animals / colors had the greatest ammount of characters.</p>
         </ul>

         <h1>Week 6 challenges</h1>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/yoLZQO">Monday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>This challenge required I had two random variables and one static variable interacting to see whether a certain goal could be reached with the addition of one variable occuring at the same time as a seperate variable is subtracted from the static base.</p>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/gxbWVE">Tuesday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>In this challenge I needed to create a ascending staircase of pound symbols directed towards the right hand side.</p>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/dzoYJg">Wednesday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>This quiz requested that we essentially play blackjack but instead of busting once we reached our goal, we needed to continue to calculate until we hit it exactly, as well as record our attempt count.</p>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/qXOdQq">Thursday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>This challenge involved pseudo coding out a problem to reach an ideal sollution.</p>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/YxyOMP">Friday's Quiz</a></li>
            <p>This quiz requested we first list out how many days each month had, and then when given a day of the week and a date, it should be able to list all of the remaining days of the month as well as their date.</p>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/collection/XwgaMa/">Weekly Challenges</a></li>
            <p>These challenges revolved around semantic HTML, making effective HTML forms, and CSS' interaction with javascript.</p>

         <h1>Week 7 challenges</h1>

            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/BdKKKL">Monday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>This challenge required us to code out how many days we've been alive. Dubiously, Mark never revealed why exactly he needed this information.</p>
            <li><a href="https://codepen.io/Tbradbury/pen/oexrmW">Tuesday's Challenge</a></li>
            <p>To complete this challenge We needed to examine an array with a random length and a random set of values, and determine how many values with the greatest number in the array were present.</p>
